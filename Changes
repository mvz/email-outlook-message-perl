0.901	2007-09-24

  - First release as module on CPAN
  - Move MSGParser.pm to Email::Outlook::MSG
  - Email::Outlook::MSG object exposes methods new and as_email_mime
  - msgconvert.pl now either does delivery to one mbox file, or to
    individual .mime files for each input .msg file.

0.20070309  2007-03-09

  - Use Email::* instead of MIME::Tools for message building and header
    processing.
  - Don't crash on multipart/signed email.
  - Move main functionality (converting .MSG file into rfc882) into
    separate file.
  - Add auxilliary files to allow this to be an installable module
    (Makefile.PL, etc).

0.20060719  2006-07-19

  - Keep MIME::Tools sedated.

0.20060225  2006-02-25

  - Simplify code.

0.20060219  2006-02-19

  - Move OLE parsing to main program.
  - Parse nested MSG files (Bug reported by Christof Lukas).

0.20060218  2006-02-18

  - More sensible encoding warnings.

0.20040825  2004-08-25

  - Replace 'our' to declare globals with 'use vars'. This means the
    globals our now properly scoped inside the package and not the file.
    This also fixes the bug that this program did not work on perl versions
    below 5.6. (Bug reported by Tim Gustafson)

0.20040530  2004-05-30

  - Extract date from property 0047 (thanks, Marc Goodman).
  - Use address data to make To: and Cc: lines complete
  - Use the in-reply-to property
  - More unknown properties named.
  - Found another property containing an SMTP address.
  - Put non-SMTP type addresses back in output.

0.20040529  2004-05-29

  - Correctly format OLEDATE.

0.20040514  2004-05-14

  - Check if $self->{HEAD} actually exists before trying to add its
    contents to the output Mime object's header data.
    (Bug reported by Thomas Ng).
  - Don't produce multipart messages if not needed.
    (Bug reported by Justin B. Scout).

0.20040307  2004-03-07

  - Complete rewrite: All functional parts are now in the package
    MSGParser;
  - Creation of MIME::Entity object is delayed until the output routines,
    which means all data is known; This means I can create a
    multipart/alternative body.
  - Item names are parsed (thanks to bfrederi@alumni.sfu.ca for the
    information).

0.20040214  2004-02-14

  - Fix typos and incorrect comments.

0.20040104  2004-01-04

  - Handle address data slightly better
  - make From line less fake
  - make $verbose and $skippable_entries global vars
  - handle HTML variant of body text if present (though not optimally).

0.20020831  2002-08-31

  - long file name will definitely be used if present.
  - Full headers and mime type information are used when present.
  - Created generic system for specifying known items to be skipped.
  - Unexpected contents is never reason to bail out anymore.
  - Added support for usage message and option processing (--verbose).

0.20020715  2002-07-15

  - Recognize new items 'Cc', mime type of attachment, long filename of
    attachment, and full headers.
  - Attachments turn out to be numbered, so a regexp is now used to
    recognize label of items that are attachments.
  - Oldest recorded version :-).
